Enhancing Histology Cancer Cell Detection with XAI-Integrated Deep Learning
Malignant Region Classification using GradCAM, SHAP, LIME, and CNN Architectures
 *Overview

This project presents an explainable deep learning pipeline for histology cancer cell detection, integrating image enhancement (UltraSharp 4× SR) with CNN models (ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16) and Explainable AI tools (GradCAM, SHAP, LIME).

* The goal is to improve:

Accuracy of malignant cell recognition

Interpretability via visualization

Clinical trust for pathologists

This work is part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Dhaka (2024–2025).

* Research Objectives

Enhance histology image quality via super-resolution.

Evaluate CNN models before/after enhancement.

Integrate XAI methods to highlight malignant zones.

Improve clinical confidence through interpretability.

Build a reproducible, modular pipeline for medical AI.
